# Log

Chronological record of wiki activity. Append-only, newest at the bottom.
Each entry starts with `## [YYYY-MM-DD] <op> | <subject>` so it's grep-parseable:
`grep "^## \[" wiki/log.md | tail -5`.

## [2026-05-10] bootstrap | wiki initialized
Created wiki structure and schema for the AI-for-medical-diagnostics research project.
- Schema: `CLAUDE.md`
- Created: `wiki/index.md`, `wiki/log.md`, `wiki/overview.md` (stub), `wiki/sources/` directory.
- Scope confirmed with human: AI for medical diagnostics, research deep-dive. One-at-a-time ingest workflow.

## [2026-05-10] ingest | LLM Wiki (meta-document)
Source: `raw/llm-wiki.md`. Filed as [[llm-wiki]].
This is the pattern blueprint — methodology, not domain content. No entity/concept pages created from it. Conventions chosen during this ingest are codified in `CLAUDE.md`.

## [2026-05-10] ingest | AI Index Report 2026 (Stanford HAI)
Source: `raw/ai_index_report_2026.pdf` (425 pp). Filed as [[ai-index-2026]].
**Read scope**: Medicine chapter in full (p. 255–287), Science chapter biomedical sections (p. 232–250), Responsible AI chapter sections 3.1–3.3 incl. KaBLE, AA-Omniscience, AIID (p. 127–146). Skipped: Education, Economy, Policy/Governance, Public Opinion, R&D — out of scope for this wiki.
**Pages created (17)**:
- Source page: [[ai-index-2026]]
- Concepts (10): [[clinical-validation]], [[fda-510k-pathway]], [[medical-imaging-ai]], [[ambient-ai-scribes]], [[llm-clinical-reasoning]], [[agentic-clinical-ai]], [[protein-language-models]], [[cofolding-models]], [[digital-twins-medicine]], [[ai-hallucination-medical]]
- Entities (6): [[mai-dxo]], [[abridge]], [[trews]], [[arise-network]], [[evo-2]], [[alphafold-3]]
**Pages updated**: [[overview]] (replaced stub with two-track-field synthesis; five-axis structure), `wiki/index.md` (new entries for all created pages).
**Notable findings to track in future sources**:
- ARISE Network 5%-real-clinical-data finding (cite the primary report when ingested).
- MAI-DxO 85.5% vs. ~20% physician comparison — case-bench, not real-world; verify Microsoft primary publication.
- KaBLE belief-vs-fact failure mode is a directly diagnostic-relevant LLM risk worth a follow-up source.
- The narrow-tool-vs-open-LLM distinction is the load-bearing organizing principle from this source.
